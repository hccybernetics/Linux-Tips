This is for my personal use: If anyone add issues with VM and non-lts kernel - this will work ( but not sure with rt-linux-imagae and zen based )

    Check the version of your installed VMware Player.

    vmplayer --version

    Get the version of your currently running kernel, in case there are multiple modules compiled for different kernel versions

    uname -r

    Download the appropriate vmmon and vmnet modules.

    Visit: https://github.com/mkubecek/vmware-host-modules/tags

    Download the appropriate module file depending on your Vmware Player version (and optionally kernel version). In this case I am running VMware Player ver. 16.2.4 and a kernel ver. of 5.19, so I would download the p16.2.4-k5.19 file. Here “p” stands for player (if you have the VMware Workstation instead, then you would download the one starting with a “w”):

Download VMware (Player and Workstation) host modules
Download VMware (Player and Workstation) host modules

    Extract the tarball file, create the tar module files and copy them over to the vmware’s source modules directory

    tar -xvf vmware-host-modules-w16.2.4-k5.19.tar.gz
    cd vmware-host-modules-w16.2.4-k5.19
    tar -cf vmmon.tar vmmon-only
    tar -cf vmnet.tar vmnet-only
    sudo cp -v vmmon.tar vmnet.tar /usr/lib/vmware/modules/source/

    Install the modules

    sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all

You should be able to launch VMware normally now.
